# Pyramid-Solitaire

The main file is form1.vb.
The other .vb files are for the extra windows for when you've lost or won the game.

You can try the game by downloading the .exe file and running it. 

FYI antivirus will probably block it.


The game was my exam project for highschool, in programming in C++
Has been translated for better understanding.
